# Pocket Caddy

Pockey Caddy is an app for tracking scores in disc-golf (possibly to be expanded to ball golf). Users will be able to keep score during rounds, reference scores later, check thier average scores and more. The app will also provide data on available courses (par, hole information, number of holes) and, as a stretch goal, allow users to enter course information to create thier own.
